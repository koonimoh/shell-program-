# shell-program-
This program is a custom command-line shell written in C that mimics the behavior of a Unix/Linux terminal. It provides a user interface where commands can be entered, executed, and managed. The shell runs in a continuous loop, reading user input, parsing it into tokens (command and arguments),.
